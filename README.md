# Digital Logic Design

This repository contains projects and coursework related to the Digital Logic Design course. It covers both theoretical and practical design aspects with combinational and sequential logic circuits. (**Instructed by Dean Lisa Shay during the Spring 2024**)

## Course Overview

The course addresses:

- **Number Systems**: Binary, hexadecimal, and decimal systems.
- **Boolean Algebra**: Simplification and representation of Boolean functions.
- **Universal Logic Families**: NAND, NOR, and other basic gates.
- **Finite-State Machines**: State tables, state diagrams, flip-flops, counters, and registers.
- **Combinational Logic**: Adders, decoders, comparators, multiplexers, and memory applications.
- **Programmable Devices**: Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA), Programmable Logic Devices (PLD), etc.
- **Analog Circuit Principles**: Real-world issues like glitches, power and ground bounce, contact bounce, tri-state logic, bus interfacing, and timing circuits.
- **Digital Circuit Characterization**: Electronic and logical properties of digital circuits.

## Projects

Projects in this course involve:

- Designing digital circuits and constructing prototypes on breadboards.
- Developing designs with programmable logic devices using CAD tools.
- Working individually and in teams to assess technical writing, oral presentation, teamwork, and project management skills.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Logisim

1. **Download Logisim**: Visit [Logisim's official website](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution) and download the latest version of Logisim.
2. **Install Java**: Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
3. **Run Logisim**: Open the Logisim .jar file to start the application. You can also run it from the command line using `java -jar logisim-evolution.jar`.
