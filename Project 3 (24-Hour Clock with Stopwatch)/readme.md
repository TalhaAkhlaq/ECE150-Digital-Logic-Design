# 24-Hour Clock with Stopwatch
Created in collaboration with [Taha Akhlaq](https://github.com/TahaAkhlaq) and [Abhijeet Khirdekar](https://github.com/akhirdekar).

## Overview  
This project involved designing and constructing a circuit that functions as both a 24-hour clock and a stopwatch using six 7-segment displays, relying solely on dip switches, pushbuttons, and integrated circuits to manage timekeeping and mode transitions, with the circuit continuously tracking time in clock mode even while the stopwatch is in use.

## Circuit File Download Instructions  
To download and open the circuit file in Logisim-Evolution, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Circuit File:** Click on the Circuit File Link
2. **Save the File:** Save the downloaded .circ file to a location where you can easily access it, like your Desktop or a designated project folder.
3. **Open Logisim-Evolution:** Launch Logisim-Evolution on your computer. If you don't have Logisim-Evolution installed, you can download it from [Logisim-Evolutionâ€™s official website](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution).
4. **Load the Circuit File:** In Logisim-Evolution, go to the top menu, click **File**, and then select **Open**. Navigate to the location where you saved the .circ file and select it to open.
